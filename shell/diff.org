#+TITLE: gnu diff notes
#+OPTIONS: H:4
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Overview
** =cmp= shows the byte and line numbers where two files differ.
** Emacs command =M-x compare-windows= can be used to compare two files char-by-char
** diff3 show diff among 3 files
** sdiff merge 2 files interactively.

* What Comparison Means

** Hunks
=diff= does not always find an optimal maching between files, =--minimal/-d= to change.

** Suppressing Differences in Blank and Tab Spacing
*** =--ignore-tab-extension/-E=
*** =--ignore-trailing-space/-Z=
*** =--ignore-space-change/-b=
*** =--ignore-all-space/-w= [fn:1]
[fn:1] =-w= does not ignore newline-related changes.

** Suppressing Differences Whose Lines Are All Blank
*** =--ignore-blank-lines/-B= [fn:2]
[fn:2] =-B= is equivalent to =-I^$= by default, equivalent to src_cpp{test}

#+TITLE: An Introduction to LOCATE

http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/03/locate-command-examples/

** locate does not search files on disk, but searches for file paths in ~/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db~, and the corresponding configuration file is ~/etc/updatedb.conf~. Some settings:
**** PRUNEFS: whitespace-separated list of file system types(~/etc/mtab~) which should not be scanned, case-insensitive.
**** PRUNENAMES: whitepace-separated list of directory names(without paths), only directories can be specified, NO pattern mechanism is used.
**** PRUNPATHS: whitespace-separated list of path names of directories
